# Jaikaâ˜…'s Networking Library
A UDP-based networking library based on client-server architecture which has been designed to be as easy-to-use as is possible, while also targeting .NET Standard 2.0 by default to enable compatability with the Unity engine by simply dragging the assembly into the assets folder. The library also includes a basic handshake stage involving a pre-defined 'secret' known by both the server and client.

## Examples
*TODO at a later stage*

### Setting up the server class

### Setting up the client class

### Creating event handlers and adding them to your client/server

## W.I.P Features
- Document ***everything*** with XML and create library documentation via the use of doxygen
- Finish adding examples to this readme
- Find a way to forcibly stop all asynchronous tasks when the client and server are closed.
